        "good": `2007 vintage. 11.7%.Popped open with a hiss. Cap shows signs of rust, as was there rust around the lip of the bottle mouth which I carefully wiped clean with damp toilet paper.Very carefully decanted into a wide-mouthed snifter glass. Aerated the pour with 6&quot; distance between the bottle and the glass. A very thankful buttermilk two-fingered head has fallen to the surface. Yellowed chestnut body looks dark and virtually impenetrable to light. Some whisps of lacing.Sweet and rich butterscotch and caramel toffee in the nose with obvious vinous characteristics. Diacetyl and sherry, probably from some level of oxidation. Soft vanilla smell upfront. Stale bread mustiness to the malt. An almost bourbon character with a hint of toasted coconut and woodsiness. A caramel dream of a dessert.Vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, oloroso sherry, buckwheat honey, raisin, brandied egg nog, nicely toasted grain, sweet alcohol, milk chocolate, and a smidge of bitter vegetation (perhaps some sort of sprucey hop resin still lingering in the finish).Soft carbonation (or what is left of it). Medium-heavy chewy body, but not sticky or cloying. Still very rich. Booze warmth going down and slight tingle in the back of the throat. All in all, held up really well.One of my favorite beers to cellar. I have a mini-vert from '07-'11. Fortunately, I've got plenty of these '07s left. We'll save the newer vintages for another time.Oh yeah, a must for appreciators of the style.\nflavor Score: 12\nmouthfeel Score: 3\nbrewing Score: 3\ntechnical Score: 3\nappearance Score: 4\noff_flavors Score: 8\nexpertness_score Score: 33`,
        "bad" : "Best IPA I Ever Had Out of a BottlePrecious and I are in the process of selling our house and buying a new one.  There is a considerable lapse of time between the closing date on our existing home and the closing date on the new one so we decided to stay at Residence Inn.  Much to my delight, they serve complimentary beer in the evenings.  They only allow two beers per room, but who do they think they're dealing with?  We had no problem getting around that.  The second night we were there they had this Goose IPA.I love IPAs, and I usually get it from one of my local breweries, but I grab it whenever and in whatever form I can get it especially if it costs me nothing.  I've tried Samuel Adams' Rebel IPA and other bottled IPAs, and they just don't do it for me.  This does it.What I like about it most is its subtlety.  It's not over powering.  In fact, if you read some of the reviews they note that it seems a bit weak.  But I like that about this.  I can enjoy the wonderful taste and smell of IPA without getting cold cocked in the face with overwhelming bitterness.  So for me, for my taste, this was awesome.\nflavor Score: 1\nmouthfeel Score: 0\nbrewing Score: 0\ntechnical Score: 1\nappearance Score: 0\noff_flavors Score: 0\nexpertness_score Score: 2\nThis beer is completely overrated.  First off, it is only drinkable by tap, the can and bottle versions aren't that great.  It's not that bad in the beginning because the flavor is decent, but the palate is too heavy, and by the end of the pint, the flavor is tiring."

    "Otter Head": 
    {
        "good": "A- slightly hazy orange copper with honey amber highlights and a scarlet trim. foam is damn near perfect for an english beer: dense and rich with a nice thick skin, beige in color, rubbery and easily built into a towering biscuit that lasts and lasts. nice spotty baby swiss lace too. looks and feels heavy.S- fruity and alcoholic, surprising for such modest abv. densely malty, toasted grains and near burnt caramel, dark rum, brown sugar, light molasses, creamy fruits, peach, strawberry, slightly floral hop aroma and aromatic sandalwood and a chocolatey cedar. very malty and nutritious aroma with some earthy hop spice.T- caramel cocoa mocha deeply toasted malt first them a wave of bitter fruitiness like berries and figs soaked in whiskey and cognac. amazingly alcoholic for a beer of this caliber, i get woozy on the first sip, even at 5.8%. a ton of malt sweetness is balanced out by the familiar earthy herbal flavor of fuggles hops and an acrid challenger bitterness. woodsy, tobacco, sherry wine cask, milk chocolate, black cherries, fermenting apple cider, and oatmeal all kinda melt together. instead of creating distinguishable 'layers' of flavor, it's more like a giant melange of subtleties that quickly blur the lines making everything a little fuzzy. MF- tip-top, rich, full, creamy, low carbonation just as i like from this style and i'm drinking it piss warm because it brings out more flavor. ok maybe not piss warm but about 60*F. in this state it's bursting with strong overall flavor and leaves the palate with a thick coating of malty goodness.D- ice cold it may be quenching and un-noticeable but i'm goin british tonight and this otter is rife with character and nutritious goodness. my only gripe is the addition of wheat, oats, and spelt which add more flavor but ultimately blend things together a little too much for me. i like crisp lines. for what it is though, a superb pub drink.",
        "bad": "I recently drank a 2002 and 2006 Old Stock side by side (in Jan. '08). The difference is remarkable. I suppose I should be rating the '06, since that's closer to what people will be drinking straight out of the stores, but I can't bare to rate such an inferior product. While there were many similarities (I'm not sure if the recipe has remained unaltered or not, but they certainly taste as if they were at least similar recipes), and the '06 tasted like something that could some day develop into the '02, the various flavors of the '06 are so much more rough and aggressive, while the '02 has allowed them to mellow and intermingle, resulting in a much rounder, more subtle combination of flavors. I cannot recommend aging this beer enough. I still have a bottle of the '02 and the '06, and plan and trying them with the '08 in '10."

    "Chimay Bleue (Blue) - Grande Réserve":
    {
        "good": "750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled in 4/2013. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big pear, apple, raisin, plum, pepper, clove, banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light/dark fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great crisp malt/fruity/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian dark ale. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.",
        "bad": "When I first had this beer, it was one of the first strong Belgians for me.  It blew me away.  Over the years, Iâve felt that while it is a complex, tasty beverage, it has been eclipsed.  Whether it is me or the beer is debatable - and indeed the topic of the perceived decline of Chimay beers over the past decade is one of the most heated in the world of beer geeks.  Well, I finally decided to sit down and give this a proper re-rate.  Iâve got a small bottle of 2004 from my local liquor store. The colour is kind of unusual in that there is a big disparity between the colour - under the light itâs a golden brown but in the glass itâs dark chestnut. The head is very light mocha.  The aroma is plummy, slightly bubblegummy with notes of honey, pears, sweet dark malts and a little bit of yeast.  Nice.  It has a sweet palate with pear, orange, and sultana notes.  A strong alcohol presence cuts through dusty yeastiness.  Flavour notes are well-fused, save for the obtrusive alcohol."

    "Post Road Pumpkin Ale":
    {
        "good": "A 355ml bottle with a BB of Feb 2013 (so just in time!). Picked up a while back from Trembling Madness in York - my intention was to drink it on Halloween or just after but I stashed it in the garage and promptly forgot about it. This is my first US pumpkin beer and the only one I've seen on sale over here.Poured into a tulip pint glass. A deep orange-amber colour with floating sediment and very low carbonation. Yields a large head of creamy white foam that lasts for a few minutes before subsiding. Aroma of cooked pumpkin and earthy spices, with hints of caramel, nutmeg, cinnamon, mild clove, faint grain, fruity ale yeast and stewed hops. Warming and autumnal.Tastes of caramel malt and restrained spice with a dry finish. Notes of pumpkin, mild nutmeg/cinnamon, faint clove, fruity yeast esters and stewed leaves. There is a harsh cardboard hint in the background, followed by a mild bitterness upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is smooth, spicy and lightly tingly, but rather undercarbonated and thin. Watery body. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of harsh stewed leaves, mild spice and faint caramel.Interesting, though as beers go it's not amazing. It seems to have no carbonation for some reason(?). The aroma was good and nicely rounded, but the flavour seemed a tad acrid and dry, with mild spice/pumpkin notes. The body was also surprisingly thin and flat. It's hard to make comparisons when I haven't tried many examples of this style, but it comes across as pretty average. OK, though no need to seek it out.",
        "bad": "Since this has just arrived in SC, a buddy of mine brought this beer over for a tasting. Not sure if this is really a strong ale -- I thought it was an ESB, but who knows...Pours a ruby-orange, quite clear, with a big bubbly spotty head.I get sweet caramel, brown sugar, and English hop bitters in the aroma. Basic and smooth smelling, not sharp at all.In fact the entire beer is smooth... sweet malt, mild earthy hop bitterness, slightly grainy... there's not a lot to this beer, to be honest. I suspect they use high mineral content water, 'cause I'm getting some interesting flavors that taste like well water. Quite drinkable.Finishes smooth and cool, rather watery mouthfeel helps the drinkability, but it's not superb er anything.Otter Head is a pretty respekkible beer, but seeing as I can only find it sold in singles for ~$4, I doubt I'll be drinking it often."

    "Goose IPA":
    {
        "good": "We crack the top and pour a brew of soft golden honey brown. It holds a one finger creamy head, showing nice retention. This leaves thick spidery lacing around the glass, and big islands of bubbles atop the liquid. Haze is thick, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears average. The aroma is a sour mash of vinegar, toffee sweetness, white sugars, gummy malts, and caramel malt. Lemony hops add to this sour, tart note, but these are comparatively faint against the grain. Lactics and cereal grain come out more with warmth. Our first impression is that this is a nice and spicy IPA, but strays a bit from the style. As we sip, fruity and citric hops mesh and blossom much more than in the nose. There is fresh apple, strawberry, and booze, along with soft cream and paler malts. The middle peaks with these pale malts, but lemon rind comes in strong, making it both more bitter and more sour. The malts also take on a bit of a toast, with a light herbal hop bitterness. These push to the finish, where there is a sweeter flash, and a mixing balance of citrus and hops, to the sour chalkiness that is the last bit of grain in the flavoring. The aftertaste breathes of hollow bitter hops, pale malts, mineral, stone, booze, sour lactics, and black pepper. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. There is nice cream, slurp, and froth to each sip, and a fine astringency dries the hard palate, while the tongue is left wet. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily.Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the drinkability. There was a nice balance by the end, and the hops remained crisp to the last drop. We found the nose to be overly dominated by hops, and we really missed that dark, fusel phenolic character so characteristic for the style. This is easily a sessionable beer, but stylistically this was not a home run for us, as we would better characterize this as a dirty American IPA.",
        "bad": "reddish almost like killians (note: not really a good thing). however, upon its initial pour, the head looks pretty solid for a few moments, which saves it. the lacing is decent. s: not as pumpkin-ey as one might like from a pumpkin ale. others say it smells like a pumpkin pie, to this i say that you must have had some awfully weak pumpkin pie. t: the taste of the beer is not bad at all, but it just doesn't really stand out like that much of a pumpkin ale. it only hints of pumpkin. m: is okay only, initially hits well, but leaves an after taste that is nothing special.d: the beer goes down rather well, and is by far its best quality. does not leave one filling fill nor with the feeling that you can't drink another.conclusion &amp; other nots: if one desires a pumpkin ale, and there are no other options (other than blue moon pumpkin ale) than by all means go for it. however, if there are any other pumpkin ale options, i would suggest utilizing them. there is really not that much to this beer. ambience: college football, fall evening, john lennon.",
