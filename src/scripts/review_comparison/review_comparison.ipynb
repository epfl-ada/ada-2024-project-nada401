      "676\tThis beer is completely overrated.  First off, it is only drinkable by tap, the can and bottle versions aren't that great.  It's not that bad in the beginning because the flavor is decent, but the palate is too heavy, and by the end of the pint, the flavor is tiring.\n",

      "-1\t14.9 ounce can into imperial pint glass, canned on 5/26/2016. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense and creamy light tan head that lasts the whole glass. Thick creamy lacing clings down the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and toasted dark bread; with light nuttiness, smoke, dark fruit, herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, and toasted dark bread; with light nuttiness, smoke, dark fruit, herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, light nuttiness/smoke/herbal, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and balance of roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from roast/bitterness, increasing through the glass. Light carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly grainy/chalky, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is okay. Very thin with no creaminess at all. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this was a decent Irish dry stout. All around good robustness and balance roast/bready malt and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. This was too thin and bit watery than I expected; but it was still quite enjoyable overall, and a good style example.\n",
      "-2\tOpaque black color with a copper hue. Thick and creamy light brown 1 finger head lasting around 10 minutes and clinging to the glass. Powerful legs with a sexy pouring activity slowly revealing the foam.Aromas and flavors of sweet smoky molasses, roasted coffee, cocoa and herbal spices. A little vinous with the smell of alcohol, almost metallic. Nice intensity and well balanced flavors, not too intense and having both sweetness and some sharpness.Smooth creamy full body with pleasant carbonation. Balanced soft finish, slightly spicy and bitter dry mouth coat with a roasted coffee feel.Overall : Very accessible classical craft. Great balance in flavors and well intensified with good freshness.\n",
      "-3\tBottle with widget. I violated bottle instructions- poured it into a glass and sat back to watch the show. The cascade took over a minute to complete, resulting in the classic putty head floating on a body as oily and dark as being lost in the woods at midnight. The layers are as sharply defined as an Oreo cookie. One of the most visually appealing beers ever. Nose of roasty espresso and whipped cream, with a smokey edge to it. Similar in flavor, but the coffee and unsweetened chocolate elements are almost hidden. Follows up with a tangy character and a bitter hop bite. Not complex, but satisfying. Feels like velvet on the tongue. Glorious lacing coats the glass like a veil. Aftertaste is a mellow, roasty bitterness. Nearly an hour after I finished, a half inch of creamy foam remained in the glass. This is the classic Irish Dry Stout, so don't diss it for not being an in-your-face imperial or double chocolate.\n",
      "-4\tAbsolutely stunning appearance: very dark brown, almost black body with a reddish tint. The dense, creamy, light-brown head stays one finger thick until the glass is empty. Burnt aroma with some mild coffee notes and vague hints of dough. The taste is very light sweet with a very light bitter finish giving a somewhat dry feel (or is the other way around?). The flavour follows the aroma, in addition to some faint raisins. The body is extremely light, the carbonation is close to flat and the texture is rather watery (or a bit creamy, if you dear to take a sip of the perfect head). Ok beer with nice (although rather subtle) aroma and flavour. However, I find it far too thin and I donât really like the lack of bitterness or sweetness (even if thatâs how a dry stout is supposed to be). If it was possible to roast water, this is what it would taste like.[44 cl can, from Kiwi Valle, Oslo]\n",

      "4497\tThe one and only Guinness... Should really get a number of different ratings based on distance to the brewery... Iâve had it there (twice), in many pubs in Dublin, and then in many other pubs around the world. The difference is huge. That said, Iâll be rating a GOOD Guinness (Dublin drunk) here. Pours black, obviously, with an incredibly thick and creamy head. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, nuts and some sweetness from dried dark fruits. Taste is sweet and creamy with a solid bitter backbone and a fairly long finish. Body is richer than anything else and very creamy.\n",
      "3817\tEnglish pint from a 14.9 oz can.  The beer poured a very dark brown/black with a very frothy, tan head.  A very roasty aroma with a bit of smoke and coffee.  The beer went down with a medium body and an abrupt, dry finish.  Very roasty and dry flavor.  Overall, I am getting used to dark beers, but I canât go this dark yet.  I will say this beer is constantly getting better as my tasting becomes better.\n",
      "1191\tDraught on tap in the Courtyard Pub in Hamilton. Too cold but very smooth. Not the stout that it is made out to be. However it is a decent product. I much prefer the foreign extra version, though its not really a fair contest as that is 7.5% ABV.\n",
      "4169\tNice apperance. Dark with at Think creamy foam. A little roasted aroma. Taste is a very watery, clean and a hint of coffee and roasted chocolate. Easy to drink but boring and thin.\n"

I do believe I have found the sixth beer to go into my top-5 favorites list!!! This is definitely part of my winter holiday food and drink repertoire! Some hearty smoked cheese and smoked wild game (venison, wild boar) are definitely going to be paired up with this hearty brew. I could see this being my go-to brew on those cold wintry night by the fireside and a hearty cigar. The alcohol content (11.3% ABV) is absolutely warming and very well hidden in this delicious brew!

      "-1\t330 mL bottle poured into a goblet. The aroma is initially a bright cherrywood note with a touch of smokiness and a light resin quality. This aroma blends into a port wine note consisting of an alcohol touch with fruity flare - tart cherry, plum, strawberry, and a light banana note - with undertones of buttery pie crust and brown sugar. It?s a murky opaque dark cherry brown with a dense foam, tan head that retains a medium-thick ring and a solid, soft foam surface, and leaves only a light, but dense wisp, lacing on the glass. The taste is a medium high bittersweet port wine. The texture is thick and oily with an abundant fuzzy carbonation to smooth things out. The body is full with lots of plum and raisin notes as well as a woody feel. There?s a mellow and smooth wine warmth at the finish with toffee, sweet cherry, and plum flavors. The aftertaste is dry and clean with a toffee and spice touch.Aged 1 yr, 3/13/2016. Strong boozy wood aromas greet the nose with bourbon port wine. This settles to eventually reveal caramel and cola. It pours a murky raisin color with soft, light, beige head that showd mild retention and sparse lace. The taste a a medium high sweet with a medium bitter. Foamy carbonation accompanies a slick texture. The medium full body has a woody spice and cola profile with a light leather quality. Tastes of smokey, light raisin emerges and turns to chocolate and cherry. The finish is similar to port wine with a clove spice and a light grape jelly. Itâs aftertaste is light, dry, and clean  with clove and mild port wine flavors\n",
      "-2\t11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip.A: Pours a very dark ruby red color with good clarity and little yeast floaties on the bottom of the glass. The head is initially a three finger light mocha color with huge bubbles and a bubbling carbonation show, ultimately settling into a one finger head with a nice creamy texture. Little lacing is left on the glass.S: Very vibrant. Chocolate, raisins, currants, plums, cherries, green pear, cloves, and spices all intermingle with great complexity; every smell provides a subtly different aroma.T: The first sip brings waves of darker dried fruits, leaving a fantastic chocolaty finish and aftertaste. The initial sips give way to more of a flavor very reminiscent of cherry pie filling. At various points afterward, I can also pick out light licorice, hints of grassy hops, fig newtons, chewing tobacco, brown sugar, spices, and other subtle hard-to-identify flavors. Stunning complexity with a fantastic lingering aftertaste. This is freakinâ heaven, plain and simple. The alcohol is as perfectly integrated as Iâve ever seen in a beer, warming the body without being palpable on the flavor.M: Amazingly smooth until the midtaste, where the yeasty astringency builds dryness on the tongue, giving it surprising drinkability. Alcohol lightly stings the tongue in conjunction with the carbonation. The dryness becomes a bit excessive at times, but otherwise it feels fantastic on the palateO: Plain and simple, a triumph of brewing finesse. Faint niggles here and there canât even come close to ruining this beerâs immense glory. Magnificent.\n",
      "-3\tSecond Review:Pours a dark opaque brown with a thick, creamy, tan head. The head dwindles and leaves lacing that is thick and clingy; CO2 only visible along the edge of the head. Aroma is malty, roasted, spicy and some hints bubblegum. The flavors are sweet, roasted, fruit, spicy. Sweet start with a tart middle and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and effervescent. A definite warming presence of alcohol. A great beer with a lot of character; complex but not overpowering.Well-balanced and intense without being over the top.First Review:Presentation: 33cl brown bottle with freshness date of 26/08/08Deep brown color a light brown head with signs of light carbonation. The head diminished to a fine layer quickly leaving a nice band of lace around the glass. Aroma is initially astringent and wine like, but more complex smells and flavors emerge as the beer warms: fruity bubblegum notes, dried fruits and caramel and an earthy background. Flavor is complex and full: sweet fruity and caramel start with a quick tart middle and a lingering tangy hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with an alcohol finish and a surprising amount of effervescence.\n",
      "-4\t11.2oz bottle that Iâve been sitting on for about 2 years. Pours a cloudy, brown colored body with an amber tint to it. Just a few trace pieces of sediment. Finger-width, creamy and frothy, tan head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is much richer than either the 6 or 8. Tons of deep caramels, chocolate, and toffee. There are also heaps of dark fruits to accompany the vast array of malts. Not as floral as the 6 or 8, but loaded with prunes, raisins, dates, plums, and definitely some black currants and other black berries. A bit of a syrupy sweetness, banana bread, thick yeasts, and some peppery alcohol. Very big, thick, dense, and complex aroma. Flavor is more the same. Heaps of caramel and chocolate, dark fruits, and some molasses-bread. Raisins, dates, prunes, plums, and a nice berry-like, black currant taste with just a pinch of sharpness. Syrupy sweetness with some more banana bread, peppery spices, nuts, earth, and a somewhat salty alcohol. Finishes rich, warm, and layered with a solid bitterness that slowly dries with a lengthy aftertaste. Full body, very smooth, and a soft, creamy carbonation. Overall, I tasted the 6, 8, and 10 side-by-side and I wanted to like the 6 or 8 more than the 10. I was HOPING this beer was overrated, but this beer is awesome. Big, soft, rich, and complex, I have nothing to complain about here. This beer is spectacular and anything but overrated. Wow.\n",

      "1844\tBeautiful nut brown with persistent creamy head. Bread, toffee and some red fruits in the nose. Caramel, bread and nuts fill the mouth with bold, nice body, fresh carbonation. Long, sweet and liquorous closure. Really marvelous.\n",
      "1809\tBottle. Pours a very dark brown a with a moderate off-white head. Nose has nominally sweet, but slightly sour notes with some stronger dark fruit in there. Taste is rather sweet and yeasty. Not my style.\n",
      "4486\tBottle, 33 cl. Dark mahogany body with a foamy beige head. Sweet, fruity and spicy aroma with quite a bit of alcohol. Notes of plums. Rich, sweet taste with light/medium bitterness. Very malty and spicy flavours. Distinct alcohol. Medium body with prickly carbonation. Somewhat overcarbonated like the other two. Dry finish with warming alcohol. A wonderful beer that provides an intense experience, but a higher ABV would have been too much. One of the best Belgian ales I have had.\n",
      "3806\tMuch darker in color than the 8, and more in dark fruit and roast on the nose. Not as tart on the nose (softer) than the Rochefort 8, with little to no head when poured. Definitely a thicker and different taste overall than 8, with a slight bitterness and even, a more oaky initial taste on the tongue. Somewhat musty on the first pour, but generally pleasant and not as shocking as some Belgians, and is in the middle-of-the road flavor-wise for the Trappist beers (I only have the Konigshoven left to try). It does have a kick, but not sharp, but you can tell thereâs something sneaky going on. basing it on other Quads, this is definitely more pleasant and \"rounder\" in flavor than others, not shifting too much to the extremes of any one taste (I guess \"balanced\" would be another word). I had this aging in the fridge (along with the 8) for 2 years, and figured this would be a nice belated \"birthday\" gift to myself to open... (Bottle Pour 3/9/2008)\n"

      "-1\t(Re-rated on 3/8/2016):Rationale: I was new to the style back then. With experience I want to revisit one of my favorite, and see if I like it as much as I was then. So here goes!330 ml bottle bought at CitySuper in Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui.Looks: Cloudy hazy amber brown colour with a layer of yeast sediments; One and a quarter finger head with creamy, lasting light beige foam; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy carbonation.Aroma: Very fragrant rich dark malt, with strong plum, raisins, figs, light Brandy, nice alcohol, vanilla, strong caramel, strong toffee, whipped cream, candi sugar, sweet bread, strong Bel yeast and light grass. Lovely!Taste: Mid to strong sweet full dark malt, with strong plums figs, metallic, smart alcohol, light liquorices, caramel, toffee, molasses, strong spices, earth, biscuits, strong Bel yeast, lime, herbs, fairly strong bitter hops and grass.Body: Full body. Dry, slick and creamy palate.Mouth Feel: Rich dark malt in a very smooth and solid background. Creamy and very Bock-ish. Then very strong plums and figs hit hard and fast followed by well-attenuated dry alcohol and liquorices and you know right away this is classy! Layered caramel and toffee with perfect medium sweetness. Most of it went to the booze, the rest is nice dryness. Spicy, slightly earthy and quite biscuit Bel yeast, round with pretty strong lime and herbs. Close to perfect!Booze: I couldnât handle the 9% abv back then and got KO-ed fast with a rush. Now the booze tasted dry, tasty and quite restrained and I appreciated it even more!Hoppiness: Light grass in nose. Lime, herbs and grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent bitter-sweet fruity malt finish.After Taste: Quite dry. Creamy, fruity and nice herbal bitter to mouth.Comments: Looking back, I think my original rating is just about right, but with a new appreciation with a bit more tasting experience today: Bold but subtle aroma and taste manifested with lots of plums, darks fruits, Bock-ish maltyness. Backed by perfectly-exceuted dry booze with subtle liquorices, and limey herbal hoppiness. All these niceties at the most affordable price you can have as Chimay being the most widely distributed Trappist beers in the city. Everything seems to works in its flavor and it earns it. Brilliant!-------- />(riginally rrated  on 6 February 2013):Cloudy dark ale brown colour; Very good head and frothy, though not as big as like Chimay White; Fine smell of caramel, vanilla, yeast, malt and some flowery fragrance; hops taste is minimal. It is very smooth to mouth with full body, creamy texture, with lingering taste of sweet toffee; lacing is not as apparent as Chimay White; Palate is subtle, lively, organically smooth throughtout with sweet after taste. At abv 9%, itâs really strong, with the rush come after 5-7 minutes but itâs gradual and you wonât get a bad trip, lovely feeling really. :)Comment: The best from Chimay, like everyone who have high regard with it, I love it for being the most subtle Chimay beers among the tri-colors; Lucky enough I bought a brunch of Chimay Blues at bargain price (looks like the people at the supermarket doesnât know how good this is!) so Iâll have a great holiday treasuring them. Definitely one of the best Trappist beer in the World. Period.(Original score: Aroma: 8/10; Looks: 4/5; Taste: 10/10; Palate: 5/5; Overall: 20/20)\n",
      "-2\tWho could honestly go past a bottle of Grande RÃ©serve Chimay and say no thankyou! This is an ale that has been tasted by near everyone with any interest in beer whether they have any inklings towards its roots or not. A background favourite of mine I waited until I had cracked a 2001 before rating this. 2004- Poured into its own chalice at around cellar temperature. Extremely muddy with the yeast dispersing into a pulped fruit mess inside the cola brown body with an enormous, creamy beige crown raising up and persisting for the length to trail fine lacing down the glass. Heady aroma, quite woody almost oak-aged with fresh pulped zesty plums, red wine dryness, spicy yeast and an underlying earthy mustiness like old hops. Lovely smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel; vinous notes set it off and develop into an earthy woody mix of malt and hops. Plums and blueberries, driftwood, peppery alcohol and yeast phenols and a hint of pecan pie develop to linger long in the mouth hiding that 9% ABV. Warming and homely, this example seemed more woody than most that I have tried with a long finish that was like a well aged plum wine. Seemed to have more age than the 2001. Quite nice. (75cL, Nookenburra) 2001- Poured into its own chalice at cellar temperature. Quite clear, deep ruby red with a tinge of brown. Head formed off the pour; extremely dense and creamy beige, held in place by streams of very, very fine bubbles to leave a mist over the glass as I drank. Pungent and tart, port-like nose with an immense spicy waft of alcohol and the famous house yeast. Other dried fruits were there with a lick of bitter/sweet chocolate and a touch of polished Jarrah (?). Extremely wine-like in the mouth; mellowing, smooth and yet prickly across the tongue with a good dose of medicinal alcohol that didnât hinder it at all. Blackcurrantâs, raisins and those distinctive plum notes abound, this was like an after dinner elixir to stir up the rawest of emotion, by the fire with a loved one perhaps. Finish is as smooth as silk letting the alcohol warm to its full extent along with a deeply vinous  roundness and depth. I love a good strong ale, and Chimay delivers with fervour. (75cL, Vintage Cellars, Adelaide) As I said âwho could go past a Chimayâ!\n",
      "-3\t750 ml bottle into signature chalice, bottled in 4/2013. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big pear, apple, raisin, plum, pepper, clove, banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, light banana, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, clove, pepper, floral, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light/dark fruits, light banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, toast, brown bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt and fruity/spicy yeast flavors; with a great crisp malt/fruity/spicy flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian dark ale. All around great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.\n",
      "-4\t2016-12-24, fresh, batch L16-066, bb 12-2021, 7-5-6-3-13=34Gorgeous look, but average taste. The aroma is somehow interesting, there is an earthy and spicy touch. The body is on the thin side for this beer, the malt doesnât have enough depth, traces of vegetables; but the final is smooth.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1988 (bb 1991), 22 years old, 7-3-7-3-14=34The cap is in good conditions, a bit rusty, but the rubber is still functional; it pours a brown color, initially with a small head, but that vanishes quickly in a whiff. Medium strength caramel aroma, with unmistakable oxidization vein, but not annoying; very light impression of dust and pond water too. It has a good body structure, stronger than most 20yearsold beers tasted so far, yet quite flat; caramel flavor, sweetish; the ageing created an extra flavor of mellow liquorice; almost no trace of bitterness, instead the sweetness is balanced by the alcohol, that is easily perceived through a pervasive warmth in the mouth. Interesting, but not outstanding.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 1998 (bb 2003), 12 years old, 7-4-6-3-13=33The cap is in good conditions; it pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; the head is initially large, but even after some time itâs still half a centimeter thick. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel and soap; also very light vanilla, wood, cake, nuts and Madeira; pleasant. Being more carbonated than the 1988, the mouthfeel seems lighter; itâs undoubtedly less sweet, even if there is a residual sweetness; there is some caramel flavor, less oxidization, and equally lack of bitterness, as well as there is almost no alcohol warmth. The two beers are similar, but in 10 years the 1998 wonât become like the 1988: not enough malty.2010-02-18, parallel tasting, vintage 2008 (bb 2013), 2 years old, 6-4-7-3-13=33It pours a dark brown color, darker than the 1988; very large head, frothy more than creamy, but quite persistent. Medium to light aroma, with some caramel, soap, refined sugar, yeast. Average body structure, definitively slimmer than the 1988, possibly drier than the 1998; there is some caramel flavor, quite boring indeed; some more bitterness than in the other vintages, more balanced therefore; the final is also a bit nutty, and the alcohol warmth is just what is expected from a 9% beer. Unimpressive.2008-02-03, vintage 2000, 7 years old, Grande Reserve corked 75cl bottle, 6-5-7-3-14=35It pours a beautiful dark mahogany color with red shades, and a creamy head. It smells too much the cork, with some caramel too, and a touch of cellar. Medium body (maybe less than the fresh one), with a good dark caramel flavor. The bitterness is almost gone. At the end the alcohol nicely warms the tongue. In the end there is some complexity, wood flavors and traces of oxidization. More an experience than a great beer.2003-01-16, vintage 2001, 1 year old, 9-5-8-4-17=43Dark amber color, generous head, reducing to a thin creamy collar.Interesting aroma: malt, light liquorice, whisky; 1 extra point for the harmony, more than for the specific characteristics.Good body structure and perfect balance of malt and hop; pretty dry taste (considering the alcohol content and style); smooth, warming, some alcohol sensation; some caramel and liquorice. Improves while warming and oxidizing.Bitter sweet final, harmonious but not particularly strong nor aromatic.I used to love this, but possibly it has changed in the last years; I would prefer other Trappistesâ¦\n",

      "1754\tA 2012 Blue Chimay. Dark brown, a bit shady. Thick white head.  Complex Belgian style yeast aroma. Strong. 9% ABV. Would probably gain if stored a couple of years (Best before end 2017).\n",
      "3751\tWhen I first had this beer, it was one of the first strong Belgians for me.  It blew me away.  Over the years, Iâve felt that while it is a complex, tasty beverage, it has been eclipsed.  Whether it is me or the beer is debatable - and indeed the topic of the perceived decline of Chimay beers over the past decade is one of the most heated in the world of beer geeks.  Well, I finally decided to sit down and give this a proper re-rate.  Iâve got a small bottle of 2004 from my local liquor store. The colour is kind of unusual in that there is a big disparity between the colour - under the light itâs a golden brown but in the glass itâs dark chestnut. The head is very light mocha.  The aroma is plummy, slightly bubblegummy with notes of honey, pears, sweet dark malts and a little bit of yeast.  Nice.  It has a sweet palate with pear, orange, and sultana notes.  A strong alcohol presence cuts through dusty yeastiness.  Flavour notes are well-fused, save for the obtrusive alcohol.\n",

      "294\tThis is the gold standard for Craft IPAs in my book. It was my first beer I had when I turned 21 and it is still amoung my favourites. It has wonderful balance and I couldn't recommend this brew more, if you haven't tried any of Dogfish Heads brews I would say run to the store and pick some of this up, crack open a few and enjoy brewing perfection. Its just a good honest beer that is very drinkable and not overpowering in any way. This is how a Imperial IPA should taste in my opinion.  5/5 O.B.D91\n",
      "540\tPaid $2 and change for a single...The appearence pours a cloudy-hazy brown base with a huge white head, nice retention and very nice lacing to follow. The smell was a little weak, you can smell a nice compelation of hops, that's it.The taste is pretty smooth, nice hops and malt blend with a touch of alcohol. The M&amp;D are up there; extremely smooth on the palette, a tocuh of alcohol from the delivery, as for the 9% abv you'll feel it, quickly.Final Thought: On prior forums, one might say this is a novelty; but hey, it works for me, and after one I'm nicely buzzed.\n",
      "462\tI poured this single 12oz. bottle into my Stone IPA glass. It is amber and is very transparent, a little bit of off white froth makes up the head.The aroma is Alpha acids up the yin yang, err my nose-yang.This tastes heavily of hops obviously! Like a carbonated pine tree tea with some grapefruit squeezed in. The high ABV warm this one up on the finish.Feels bubbly a good dose of carbonation / medium bodied on the tongue. I'm all set after about one of these because they are so rich (in hops) and intense. I like my IPAs a little less in your palette, and a little bit lower in ABV. This is more of a treat, kinda like a candy apple.Overall: I enjoyed this DFH beer as they put quality and interesting brews, but by no means is it my favorite IPA. I prefer the 60 minute, and for now will stay away from the 120.\n",

      "-1\tDo you remember the Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA? All that robust and citrus hop character and the immensely crisp and refreshing bite? Well, the 60 minute was actually not the first continually hopped IPA that Dogfish Head made - before the 60 came the 90 Minute IPA; an Imperial IPA which was first brewed at the Dogfish Head Brewpub, and is now the Best Selling Imperial IPA in North America, and potentially the world.The 90 Minute IPA utilizes continual hopping during a ninety minute boil to create a pungent hop aroma and flavor, rather than an overbearing one. Beyond that it is also dry hopped during conditioning to increase its lively fresh hop character.Just like the 60 Minute, the 90 is not for everyone. People who claim to not enjoy the bitter bite of hoppy beers would not be impressed by the 90, or the 60 for that matter. But if you are a hop-head, or can appreciate the savory bitter and fresh characteristics of rich hops than this Imperial India Pale Ale is a magnificent treat!The 90 comes in 341ml bottles which you can often find in four packs all across the United States. They have not yet found their way into Canada unfortunately. It is 9.0%abv, and also is rated at 90 IBU (International Bitter Units). I am lucky enough to have a Dogfish Head Chalice, so I pulled the 90 out of the fridge to warm a touch, prepared the chalice, and also a nice comfortable spot on my couch to enjoy this in.The 90 Minute IPA pours smoothly with a mild viscosity to it. It slowly builds in the bottom of the glass with little vigor, but soon as the bottle in half way through carbonation is now erupting from the bottom and a large and fluffy almost two inch head is developed brilliantly above the beer. The head is creamy white and filled with airy bubbles perfectly resting just below the edge of the glass.The beer itself is transparent and rich - its glows a copper orange with a lot of red, mahogany and caramel. The contrast between the beer and its foam is magnicifent - it already shows body and rich soul. The nose is round and balanced with warm and rich pale malts, smooth hops bitterness, and light sweet caramel. The malt here is most prominent, which is surprising when you contemplate the 60 Minute IPA. Hops here just linger around showing a touch of citrus, pine and earth. It is also warmer in alcohol; the caramel from the malt brings with it a slight whiff of 9%.Just as Sam Calagione (Dogfish Head founder) describes, the 90 minute continual hopping is used so to add hop flavor, not hop brutality. And here is shows its power in spades. Let the 90 pour over your palate, don't sip it right away, really get a nice mouthful. The sweetness from pale malts show themselves on your tongue, but then a smooth layer of hops show themselves in grapefruit, lemon peal, earthy pine, grass, spice and fresh herbs.The balance is really impeccable; smooth and soft caramel flows across your cheeks and the roof of your mouth, all while a deep resin of hops float throughout your mouth. As the beer warms, more sweetness shows itself and the fresh bitter becomes more brash and citrus. It begins to touch raisins and fruitcake almost bringing more complexity to the picture. The finish is soft and full, with only slight quenching characteristics.The beer is less carbonated, less aggressive, and less crisp than the 60 minute IPA. And many people do criticize it for that. However it is more balanced, and better constructed, with more depth of flavor and rounded sensations. Its an interesting wold this - most people who look for an Imperial IPA are hop heads and want to be crushed by the one sided insanity of a 60 Minute IPA, so the 90 is too balanced for them and not quite insane enough.The 90 to me is a sublime IPA with amazing character and genuine flavors which compliment the brewers and their efforts. It has an elegant mouthfeel, perfectly smooth malt flavors with complex hops dancing with it. The 90 seems to be living in a more sivilized world than the 60 Minute IPA.It will also age well over time with the added strength and sweetness, and pairs magnificently well with beef, potatoes, cheesy breads, olive oil based pastas, rich cheeses, and rich cheesecake.\n",
      "-2\t12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled on 12/02/09 (so around 2 months old). Appearance: Decently strong pour yields a 1 inch frothy head that quickly dissipates. Semi-translucent orange with bubbles rising in the middle. Continents of lacing stick around for awhile, then fade. Smell: Floral, grassy, herbal, and citrus hops. Sweet, with lots of fruit, and some bread and alcohol notes. Deep nose that's hard to pin down, but very nice. Develops as the beer warms; starts hoppy and fruity, now it's very hot alcohol, now it's savory like Korean BBQ (!), now it's grassy and bready. I'm a sucker for beers that give me a great aroma at first, then proceed to show off entirely different but equally beautiful aromas as the night goes on. Taste: First sip: big and bitter hit of grassy hops with sweet and varied esters popping up right away and a smooth but not very lasting malty finish. As I get deeper into the beer, a pleasant alcohol warmth builds in the chest and the malt profile displays large notes of caramel and toast. Myriad fruity esters are present in every sip, which are, like the smell, difficult (for me) to pin down and identify. The heavy IBU is balanced by the depth and variety of fruit and malt flavors. Finish gradually gets rather bitter, but after the flavor assault that is the majority of each sip, I don't mind not getting the nice long bready aftertaste of some other great IPAs.It's easy to drink this beer without thinking too much, and simply enjoy the big, obvious hops, pleasant fruitiness, and caramel/toasted rye bread malt. If that's all there was to taste, 90min would still be a great beer. However, if you sit down and savor each sip, there's just an endless depth to the flavor. Various fruits, ranging from sweet and bright to dark and musty, different bready notes, different consistencies (creamy/oily/juicy/sharp and bitter/smooth, warm bread/harsh, warm alohol), some phenolic bites, herbal and floral notes, all emerge and interact with the constantly developing aroma. I've been drinking this beer for a few years now, and I still don't feel like I ever exhaust the depth of its flavor. Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied, with rather heavy carbonation. Good vehicle for the deep taste, but more difficult to like after you've had Squall IPA (at least for me). Drinkability: Disappears quickly, with a very sneaky ABV. 1 is enough, but you'll want more. Like Stone's Arrogant Bastard, DFH 90min IPA is as good as you'd expect the flagship beer of a premier American craft brewery to be (ie excellent). It's a bit... brash, at least in comparison to Squall IPA, which is my only real criticism (a somewhat half-hearted criticism to be honest). The flavors and aroma are bold and exquisite. A classic beer that should be tried by everyone who even remotely likes beer.\n",
      "-3\t&quot;What you have here is an Imperial India Pale Ale featuring a single, constant 90-minute hop addition. It's balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley. Then we dry-hop it in every tank.&quot; Brewed in the style of an American Imperial IPA. This is the big brother IPA to the 60 minute, available year round in 4 pack bottles and on draft. One of Dogfish Head's finest successes. this is a beer that revolutionized the hop addition process in brewing.Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to the Dogfish Head Signature glass. Served north of 52º Fahrenheit.(Appearance) Pours a frothy ivory head over a bold copper orange body with very high clarity. Carbonation is plentiful and varied. Retention is average, lacing is light and streaked. 3.75(Smell) Caramel grain malt with a moderate sweetness. Smooth herbal, resinous and citrus hop blends intertwine with a modest bitterness. A moderate mineral earthiness is also present, hints of white grape, pear and honey add inviting depth to the aroma. Mild ethanol doesn't distract the aromatic diversity of this Double IPA. The balance of this beer is fantastic with just enough malt and hop character to keep things exciting. Potency is medium. 4(Taste) Clean, smooth bready caramel malts collaborate with a resinous, floral and lemony hop profile. Bitterness is fantastic, just enough for a strong trailing bitterness but doesn't overshadow the malt character in the finish. I appreciate the unique use of British malts and a mild mineral profile which smooths out just about any gap in flavor this beer could have. I enjoy the high drinkability, flavor and balance that this beer has, it is a deserving standout beer amongst a world of Double IPAs. 4.5(Mouthfeel) Smooth, clean, fluffy with a mild chewiness. Carbonation adds a middling crispness for a frothier texture. Body is medium for the style, medium+ overall. Alcohol presence is light to none. 4.25(Overall) This is one of the most drinkable Double IPAs you can get for your money. With the perfect balance of hop and malt character I find little worthy of criticizing in this beer. If you are new to Double IPAs, this would be an ideal starter beer to go with. 4Dogfish Head Brewery'sDogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA4.24/5.00\n",
      "-4\tPoured from a 12oz bottle into a SA perfect pint glass.A: Bright golden-amber; sparkling body when held up to light; lots of tiny carbonation bubbles racing to a slightly rocky white head, about 1 finger thick. Head reduces to a ring on top of the body; lots of sticky, white lacing.S: Pungent, citrusy hops hit the nose from the moment I pop the cap - huge, tart grapefruit, herbal notes, slightly minty, a tad bit of earthiness. Just faintly pick up on the malts in the background - just a light, sweet biscuit/baked bread note hiding behind the volume of hops.T: Hops blast the palate with a uniquely grapefruit citrus flavor - a tart, rind-like edge with a lot of residual sweetness following the initial burst of bitterness. Hops also give off a faintly minty/herbal bite which quickly fades as the malts ascend.  Sweeter than other IPAs I've tried - I attribute this to the greater balancing effect from the malts - with a smooth biscuit and honey flavor that plays nicely with the residual fruity sweetness. Alcohol comes in near the finish with a quick, spicy punch. Aftertaste comprised of some lingering hop bitterness which gives away to a milder, malty biscuit note. Delicious and very smooth; flavors meld nicely, creating a much more balanced profile.M: Very crisp carbonation across the palate keeps the mouthfeel lively and refreshing. Carbonation plays well with the abundance of citrusy hops. Slightly slick feel on the swallow.D: 9% ABV means one, two bottles max, but this IPA is surprisingly more drinkable than I expected. A lot of reviews suggest the 90min IPA is almost too sweet, but I think it helps with the drinkability by masking the heat from the alcohol (as well as rounding out the hop bitterness).  Rest assured, the alcohol does peek through with greater presence near the end of the glass, as the beer reaches room temp.DISCLAIMER: I'm not a &quot;hop head&quot; or that big into IPAs in general, but this beer is quite good - I'd go so far to say it is my favorite example from a style I'm not really all that versed in. I liked the Stone Ruination for what it was, but I think 90min takes the nod here. The  citrusy grapefruit notes (I quite enjoy grapefruit) balanced beautifully with a steady malt backbone to create a bold yet highly refreshing beer for a warm summer evening. I was really diggin' DFH's 60min , but the 90min is far and away superior, even if a 4 pack costs me the same as a 6 pack of the 60min... definitely worth the price.  I think this is a well-executed DIPA - one which nudges me back into the direction of giving other IPAs another chance to impress.  This is the yardstick by which I will measure.\n",

      "1673\tA- An orange-yellow color mixture, with about an inch of foamy head that is creamy with a tint of yellow. Not as much head retention as one would think.S- is not that impressive, can make out moderate tones of orange and citrus smell, hops, but very little to no pine.TM- starts out very smooth and light with the citrus nodes, quickly changes to a hop bite at the end. Each sip of it seems to change and develop as the beer gets warmer. Very well balanced and enjoyable.D- This beer is scary drinkable at 9.00 ABV.Notes: This is a very solid beer. Nothing about it blew me away. It is a solid DIPA, but I believe that it is way over hyped. Maybe I just had too high of expectations for this beer. It was very solid and I would drink it again, but as for my expectations for it, this one was a bit of a let down.\n",
      "3670\tFrom a 12 oz. brown bottle, awesome to see this brewery available in Alberta finally. Gorgeous looking pour, a tall off-white merengue head crowns a deep rustic copper hued body. Excellent retention on the head, thick rings of lacing in its wake, amazing to see with such a high hop content.Intense toasted, woody malt on the nose, along with sweet citrusy and floral hops. Always tends to end off with a smoky, earthy note, even cutting through the hops.Impressive balance in the flavour as both parties are quite robust. Rich biscuity toasted malt split evenly down the middle with one of the most contained and well-mannered large hop profiles I've yet to encounter. Because of this it's almost like drinking a pale ale turned up to 11 rather than a double IPA, except that the alcohol volume makes its presence known before the glass is emptied.Mouthfeel is full and rounded and smooth, a bit thick in parts, and only slightly soapy on the finish.Glad I had the chance to try this, and will be going back for more, it would make an excellent session ale if it weren't for that amplified abv%.\n",
      "2216\tA - This is a great looking IPA. It has a clear and crisp deep orange body with a modest head that is pure white and it appears to be going nowhere. Very inviting brew.S - Rich and smooth hoppy aroma that begs for consumption.T - Wow... It has a smooth hoppy flavor to start. It's followed by a hint of alcohol and a Belgian style malt flavor that really makes this unique. The finish is that of soft hops. This brew is not at all bitter.M - The feel is smooth and soft throughout with a hint of action in the finish. Overall the brew goes down extremely well, probably too well. ~ This is the best IPA I've ever had. I am so grateful to Mr. Mike Williams of Stevens Point, Wisconsin for his generosity. He traveled to Milwaukee and brought this beer back to me as a birthday gift, and what a gift it has been. My thanks also go out to his wife, Ranee, I don't doubt she too had a say in this wonderful beer choice. Thanks you two.\n",
      "2747\tI finally got around to trying Dogfish Head's 90-Minute IPA. It pours a hazy, light orange/yellow color with a small white head that just hangs around. The smells is where this beer really shines. Lot of sweet, candied hops are on the nose. Apricots and a bit of earthiness show up. I could smell it all day.Tasting the beer reveals more grassy hop flavors, along with a bit of sweet caramel and just a hint of roastiness. There is a smooth bitterness but nothing over-the-top. There is just a bit of alcohol burn after the swallow. The mouthfeel is very nice and full with a medium amount of carbonation. This is a really good beer. Compared to some other double IPA's I've had, this one isn't nearly as in-your-face, but I think that is a good thing and makes it much more drinkable. Possibly dangerously so, considering the 9% ABV.\n"

Just like a good stout should be.D -- A great winter warmer when Irish Coffee isn't your thing, a great beer for a fall campout or just when you're out of milk for cereal...\n",
      "293\tPitch black. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. A load of coffee. A few days ago I did drainpour another beer for the same reason. Which automatically makes me skeptical on this one which I have been waiting a long time to get my greedy little hands on. Let's taste it. Well this is not really bad. Now I get some malts too, maybe a sweet dark fruit component. My problem with this is that I hate cold coffee. And I don't want to boil this beer. What can I say about it? Maybe I don't like the style but this is a major disappointment. Will not buy again. But is just my problem. I guess.\n",

      "-1\tOh boy. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle acquired at a beer store near my work and served into a New Belgium goblet in me gaff in Los Feliz, California. I had never seen this in the LA area until recently. 8.3% confirmed. Expectations are through the roof; I had Kentucky Breakfast Stout and loved it. I'm hoping this also lives up to the hype. Cost was $6.99 (people on the East Cost are probably cringing). Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm considerably over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. As I poured, no head was forming so I upped the vigor considerably. A: Pours a beautiful rich dark tan colour head half a finger thick with excellent cream. Retention is abysmal (maybe 20 seconds). Colour is a solid nontransparent jet black. It looks as it should for the style, but I would like to see better retention. It's a minor gripe. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Appears undercarbonated. Sm: Heavy rich coffee java notes. Heavy coffee bitterness. It really slaps you upside the head. I get minor chocolate, roast, and oatmeal notes - sure. But strong coffee is dominant. An aggressive strong aroma that goes for the jugular. Dark malts. It's very assertive and bold.No hops are detectable. No yeast or alcohol comes through.T: Heavy coffee, with some bitterness there at the finish. Chocolate malts and a bit of chocolate alongside dark malts comprises the foundation. I'm a bit surprised actually; it lacks a substantial body. Not a usual characteristic of beers in the style. Oats are there smoothening it through and through. No real cream. No yeast or alcohol comes through. The coffee notes are rich and biting. Hopping is minimal and floral but barely detectable (just as it should be). A light undertone of warm sherry throughout. I imagine this will improve as it warms. Some raisin, even some molasses sure. I don't get any herbal notes as some have reported. A touch viney. No real caramel. No nuts here. It isn't &quot;that kind&quot; of imperial stout. Very delicately balanced and built. They knew what they were doing when they put this treat together. As it warms, I get more true milk chocolate notes (not merely chocolate malt). Mf: I'm a bit taken aback at the blatant undercarbonation. It's naturally smooth from the oats, nicely wet, and quite chewy. Suits the flavours quite well, and it really evokes a clean breakfast beer - because who really wants carbonation in the morning. I understand the intentionality behind the choice, but that said I still think I'd prefer it creamier, thicker, and even a bit coarser and dryer. I like it as is, though; I'm just identifying personal preference. Dr: I can definitely see myself having this for breakfast. Boy that'd be good. Very drinkable; I imagine the caffeine zing from the coffee could keep you steadily drinking it for some time. It's not at all in the creamy heavy thick arena of imperial stouts. It's more a sharp coffee imperial stout, and in that it's quite a success. I'm not disappointed with it, but I will say that I remember enjoying KBS far more than this offering. Still, Founders seems to always deliver - at least based on the few beers I've had from them. At $6.99, I wouldn't get this again, but would at $3.99 or better. A must-try for fans of the style; great for the style. It doesn't quite join the ranks of something like Brunch Weasel or Speedway stout in terms of coffee-centric imperial stouts, but it flirts with that level; pretty impressive at this price point. Hides its ABV delightfully well. I'll definitely be having this again, ideally aged or on draught. An understated, elegant beer. Bravo, Founders. I initially gave it a B+, but changed it up to an A- because as it warmed, it got noticeably better. Give her some time once you pull her out of the fridge. It's worth it.A--Bottle from Duff27. Adding some brief notes; served into stemware.A: Retention is better than the first review - a good 4 minutes. I think the glassware makes a big difference; I poured pretty lightly. Creamy, dark, appealing. Sm: Strong black coffee. Evident bitterness. Very assertive. Evocative oatmeal too; oats are usually undetectable and contribute mainly to mouthfeel but they're evident here. I like that.T: Heavy coffee with accompanying bitterness and roast. The coffee here is really genuine; it doesn't shy away from the raw coffee bean character. Mf: Creamy, chewy, coarse. Perfect dryness. Dr: A solid brew; lives up to its well earned reputation. Possibly the best value beer of its quality. A-.-10/09/13 (Fresh FBS):A: Soft complexion. Even lacing coats glass. Sm: Sinful coffee w/ roasty, creamy, and espresso notes. Rich and decadent. No hops/yeast. Could use more roast. Coffee gets a bit too bitter. Room for more complexity/subtlety. Above avg depth of flavour. Avg flavour intensity/duration for style. B+\n",
      "-2\tThis is one of my favorite beers, but it's so delicious that a) I've always downed it and shared with others so not to seem greedy, and b) it's never received a proper review after all of this time. The bottle I'm reviewing is nearly a year old, to my knowledge, but I do know how this is fresh and therefore will be adjusting my scores properly. Thanks to everyone who's provided me a bottle over the course of the past year. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.Pours a blackened treacle of a stout, appearing as opaque as the thickest ones in the style, and yet retains a humble appearance that is appealing and accessible. Amazingly, this looks a lot like freshly brewed coffee, with black tones, as well as a mocha head that coats the top in a foamy and long-lasting manner. Leaves a ton of lacing in its wake, which also is very coffee-like. Head retention is excellent, as always, and lasts a good long while. The alcohol legs are slightly intense, and leave behind coatings of foam along with the tears. It's an unmistakable beer in its category already in the appearance, that's for sure.Smells of vibrant coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit notes, with a combination of sweetened and bitter phenols that is unbelievably appealing. At first, you get an immediate roasted character from the coffee that imparts bitterness, roasted notes, and fruity, slightly tropical notes (as found often in Kona and Sumatra) that resembles juicy plums, prunes, and peaberries. At the finish, there are notes of dark cocoa nibs and vanilla, as well as roasted barley and oats that impart the very feeling of walking into a room where a hearty breakfast is being cooked. The final result is uncanny - bitter and roasted, but sweet and chocolate-y with a robust, fresh edge. World-class stuff right here.The flavor is by far the highlight right here - it is, simply put, an explosion of roasted freshly ground coffee, chocolate, barley, and fruity notes right at the front of the palate. At first, there's coffee, espresso ground notes that impart an appealing bitterness and flavor that is also fruity, with dank tropical and herbal notes. The chocolate soon follows, with incredible vanilla, nutty, and cinnamon notes, and perhaps a bit of syrup (maple?). Not sweet by any means, but extremely balanced in light of the coffee bitterness. Soon after, there are wonderful bready roasted notes from the barley, as well as a sharp zest and grassy sensation from the hops. The oats provide a more robust and breakfast-like flavor, but also a ton of creaminess that makes this wonderfully easy to drink. Goes down silky smooth, and I think stouts of this nature should always be this way. Come to think of it, I can see why I never got around to reviewing this until now - it's creamy, well carbonated, robust, velvety, dessert-like, and hearty. Absolute perfection. One of the best stouts on the planet by default. I want this in my house year-round, and just like a great slice of pie, it works for any time of the day, any temperature, or any occasion. Brilliant stuff, and without a doubt Founders crowning achievement. I love this so much that I actually brewed a clone of this, but my copy did not reach the level of robustness that this hold even this late since it was bottled. The only off aroma may be a bit of soy saucy flavors while it's older, but it's still ridiculously flavorful. Recommended to the max. A masterpiece of a stout.\n",
      "-3\t355ml bottle poured into a sniffer.Opaque black in color with a reddish shade around the edge when hits the light, the pour yields one finger of sudsy tan head that retains itself for a while before collapsing to some long-lasting foamy sheet on the surface, it doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip, lots of sticky lacing patch and spot appeared on the glass-side from time to time.Very aromatic coffee and chocolate in a nose with varieties of scent ranging from espresso, americano, mocha, yet milky and creamy chocolate. There is vanilla too, as well as, dark bread, licorice, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, and roasted profiles while hop same time provides notes of earthy, citrus, and subtle spice. The aroma is more open with prominent quality of coffee when the beer warmed.The taste of espresso, americano, and mocha is in the lead with nicely sweet milky chocolate followed shortly. Then it is roasted malt with some astringency together with dark bread, burnt wood, charred nuttiness, and some vanilla. Thanks to oat for the sweet, soft, and smooth. Those coffee flavors become much bolder and coat the taste buds before hop trying to add in its citric, slight spice, and earthy. Some bitterness and some astringency at the finish, in which mostly derive from the roasted and coffee profiles. Overall, it is sweet but not that overwhelming sweet since there are many layers of flavor to keep the ball in control.The body is full and quite viscous but not too sticky with velvety yet silky smooth mouthfeel and some lively crisp carbonation through the palate, dry finish.Full of aroma, full of flavor, full of feeling, this brew is not that kind of super complex but it is big and intense, truly an enjoyment in glass. Alcohol is also well concealed making it not too hard to get along and great for sipping.\n",
      "-4\tFounders Breakfast Stout (Original Review 12 Sept. 2012)Poured into a large brandy snifter at cellar temp.A:Dark brown to black. A very faint ring of cola-colored light peeks through at the edge, but then plunges into a deep darkness. A thin head of an orange-tinged kahki color struggles to appear when the glass is swirled. It fights to stay present, floats a little, but then dissipates quickly. It seems light and not oily in the glass. Looks medium bodied and not to dissimilar to Coca-Cola. Tight but inconsistent lacing, below average retention.S:Roasty and acidic milk chocolate. If you swirl it and bring the head back, the head has a more pleasant, creamy chocolate aroma. I’m getting a little graininess from the oatmeal. White sugar peeks through along with a little bit of alcohol and some dry roast bitterness. The coffee is faint for me, but I will disclaim that statement by saying I am a MASSIVE coffee nerd – it might be more prevalent to someone who drinks less coffee than I do! This brew had an almost artificial nose at first, but that seemed to go away as I played around with it.T:A round, creamy but slightly light flavor of milk chocolate gives way to a dry, dark chocolate finish. This brew doesn’t display much on the attack - it does not attack my taste buds when it hits - but the mid plate and finish display some complex and tasty notes of bitter, pleasant, and roasty dark chocolate. There is definitely some flavor of luke warm coffee on the back end as well. If I aerate a sip as soon as it touches my tongue, I get a sugared, lightly creamed coffee flavor… but I really have to work for it. No alcohol really gets through in the taste which surprises me because I could detect in the nose.M:The oatmeal gives this brew a delightful “roundness” in the mouth without being too syrupy, oily, or heavy. Medium viscosity and medium bodied in my opinion. Remarkably drinkable.O:Very solid stout. Not my favorite oatmeal stout (that honor still belongs to that amazing hybrid B.O.R.I.S.), but an absolute delight to sip on… this is almost the definition of a sipper. I enjoyed tasting and observing how this brew evolved over the course of my review. I think this is a great beer geek beer as well as a delicious way to introduce others to the delights of craft beer. Very elegantly crafted and superbly well made. Subtle, intricate, and most importantly, delicious. This beer actually reminded me of some of the better crafted wines I have had – not one aspect of this beer stands out over another, instead each aspect plays well with the next to create a perfectly crafted beer.UPDATE: (21 Sept. 2012)Had this beer again today, this time on tap in a standard pint glass from a large format (keg) at the Founders Breakfast Stout release event at Kellehers Irish Pub in Peoria. Tasted coffee like crazy! Served at a slightly colder temp than I reviewed it the first time. Tonight, it has a great balance; not overly thick as some oatmeal stouts, with an awesome, roasty coffee finish. Large format serving was definitely better than the bottle serving I reviewed earlier this month. If you have the chance to try this one on tap, DO IT! Still didn't even get a hint of this brew's 8.3% ABV. Tonight's taste reaffirmed my initial impression: &quot;Remarkably drinkable.&quot;\n",

      "1656\tRich thick black with hints of a deep maroon around the edges. Even cold from the 'fridge, this one smells of freshly ground coffee, overpoweringly so. The smell lingers all the way through a nicely warmed bottle's worth. A little chocolate comes out as the beer heads toward room temperature.Suprisingly lightly carbonated, which increases the beers resemblance to coffee considerably. Certainly tastes like it, masking almost everything else. A hint of chocolate and oatmeal each come and go, returning again to a freshly roasted and ground coffee flavor. I feel almost well rested after drinking half a pint.Very smooth, although the coffee adds just a hint of friction. One to savor again and again.\n",
      "3653\tPoured from a 12oz bottle (dated 9/8/15) into a Tulip.  Inky-black, topped by a 1-finger tall khaki head with good retention. Lacing all the way down the glass isvery good.Nose has prominent notes of black coffee, cocoa,  and sweet malts.Flavors feature sweet caramel malts, molasses, and brown sugar, balanced extremely well with bittersweet chocolate up front.  Coffee bitterness, toasted nuts and earthy notes come in later on, leading to a finish that lingers with coffee and cocoa on the palate.Mouth-feel is medium heavy, a big beer but surprisingly easy to drink. Full-bodied but not quite as crushingly weighty as other stouts; very smooth and satisfying without being overwhelming. Carbonation is fairly light, and the alcohol provides a pleasantly soothing warmth without ever being boozy.A much-ballyhooed beer that delivers on the hype, big time. All the flavors are remarkably balanced, with different notes coming in and out of focus as the beer warms, and the nutty undertones and smooth body from the oatmeal only make this even more appealing.  I suppose if someone didn't like coffee, or chocolate, or big malty stouts one might not be pleased with this one, but if any of those things are to your liking this might be in your wheelhouse.\n",
      "2199\t12oz bottle served in an oversized wineglass.pours a luscious, borderline black tone with a finger, finger and half of a tan/mocha head; average retention, although some nice walls of lacing are evident.robust, aromatic nose greets me way before i lean in for my first whiff. bold notes of coffee interplay with a strong chocolate presence, followed by roasted malt. one of those literally mouth-watering aromas.taste follows the nose, replete with rich coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors. here is where i pick up on some oatmeal, although it's subdued. slightly bitter finish. to be honest, i was prepared to be disappointed after all the hype that fueled the reputation of the FBS, but this is pretty damn delicious.full, velvety mouthfeel; moderately carbed. very, very drinkable for an imperial stout.original review on: 09-23-2010\n",
      "2730\tAppearance: Founders Breakfast Stout pours very close to pitch black with a dark mocha head. It does look pretty viscous. Retention is pretty nice, as is the lacing. Smell: This beer smells of a lot of roasted malt and coffee. Underneath it all I can get notes of chocolate and perhaps a bit of oat sweetness. It's a nice smell, but a bit one-dimensional.Taste: Roasted malts and coffee/expresso form the backbone of this beer. Also quite a bit of bitter chocolate and a touch of sweetness from the oats. Very nice.Mouthfeel: Very thick and viscous. Fairly low carbonation leads to a bit of a slick mouthfeel. I haven't had many stouts with a mouthfeel this heavy bodied. Phenomenal. Drinkability is pretty high, there are tons of great flavors in this beer. Very solid effort by Founders, as usual.\n"

      "451\tI had been looking for this brew for quite a while. Was very interested to see if it lived up to the hype. I was not let down in the slightest.Upon pouring into a pint glass I got 2 fingers of a beautiful lacy head.I did expect a bit more nose, but it was pleasant. Grapefruit with pine notes. But you do have to dive it to get a good whif.The color is a clear hay not as deep as one might expect. But quite pleasing.The taste is were this wonderful elixir shines. More subtle at first sip then I figured, but as the glass progressed the depth was stellar.The mothfeel was just as it should be with nice mild carbonation.The drinkabillity is top notch. You could imbibe all day and night enjoyng every sip.\n",
      "287\tOh the mighty Pliny... Waited quite a while to finally try to gem. I was tipped off by a gentleman that moved to Pa from Cali about where to get Pliny in our area. He spoke if the Spinnerstown Hotel as if it was a sacred holy land of beer... He wasn't too far off! Long story short about a year after he mentioned it to me I saw the S. Town Hotel got it in on tap! I wanted to leave work early that day and fly down there asap! I walk in the door and the same dude from a year ago is tossing back Pliny's like he just bought the keg. I walked up to the bar and got my 1st one. The guy didn't remember me from before and got upset that I was ordering &quot;his&quot; beer! I told him that it's his fault because he tipped me off about it... Anyway it's got a lovely golden yellow color with a nice head in it. The aromas are breath taking. The flavors of pine like hops sting your mouth and make you beg for more. This beer is so tasty! I ordered 5 in a row that night. Coulda had 5 more, shoulda called a cab!\n",

      "-1\tAnother infamous beer is siting in front of my face. A few months ago I was able to enjoy the Westvleteren 12, the highest rated beer on the planet. Now I am about to enjoy a bottle of the Russian River Pliny the Elder; the second highest rated beer on the planet. I have learned quite a lot about drinking these so notoriously famed beers, most notably is not to concern yourself so much with its fame. This could be the most powerful influence on your perception of taste before you have even had the beer. So to best enjoy and evaluate the beer you must ignore it. So I will say no more of its rank. Russian River's Pliny the Elder is a West-Coast Double American IPA. Pliny the Elder was actually a Roman Naturalist, scholar, historian and writer. Russian River seemingly dedicated this beer to Pliny's memory because he was among a few who created the botanical name for hops, lupus salictarius, which later became known as humulus lupulus. There is no IBU measurement listed on bottle or the web site, but simply because of its dedication and origin, we can rightfully expect something pretty hoppy. The Pliny comes in 500ml bottles and is available year round in California. I do like that Russian River is selling it in a 500ml bottle rather than a 355ml. Honestly for a quenching IPA, even one at 8%, more is better, and 355ml usually just wont cut it. I opened the Elder up cool around 8C (45F) and poured it into a few snifter glasses to share with my friends. The pour was smooth and silky unfolding out of the glass with a oil-like texture. It hit the glass hard and built up with a heavy glowing amber liquid. A head was slow to form, but by the end of the pour a solid pale white foam had build 1 inch over the beer showing relatively dense carbonation and a creamy cap. The beer was really shinning at me. It was a bright and shimmering orange with hints of amber brown and big golden streaks beaming through it. The Pliny was totally opaque, and settled into a smooth and attractive beer. The nose is all hops showing a resiny punch of west coast, and highly aggressive earth aromas. The biggest up front is a sticky pine and woodsy aroma that bring with it a soft wave of citrus, grapefruit and lemon peal. It has hops written all over it and is brimming with the oily aromas of fresh humulus lupulus. Malt sweetness shows hints of sugary caramel and a balancing act of mellow pale malt, but they are nonetheless only there to help showcase the triumph of centennial, warrior, chinook, simcoe and columbus hops. It is actually very nice and smooth and not pungent or sharp. Great aroma. With my first few sips I tried to get through the wall of hops to try and find some malts, which I did... But there was no fighting it. This beer was built with a purpose. Smooth and gentle waves of hops ride into your palate showing a layered complexity of hoppy flavors. Piny fresh needles, citric fruits, clean zest and sweet earthiness all play along together in a harmoniously quenching hop symphony. There is a mellow and smooth malt sweetness that does shine though. It is clean and gentle with classic pale malt and gentle caramel flavors. Smooth and easy is its duty here as to not disturb the presence of the hops. At the back end of this beer hops still shine though. The tangy sweet hops that came in front brought tropical flavors of pineapple, orange zest and grapefruit. Now though I am being quenched more by earth, apples and pine needles. This is a hopehead's beer, that is for sure. From start to finish this beer was quenching and very delicious. What impresses me is the complexity and layers of flavor that the hops bring rather than just a simple one sided hop blast. The texture and mouthfeel too are perfect with a smooth and elegant feeling balancing off moderate, but appropriate carbonation. It finishes cleanly with more citrus and pine leaving you with a fresh palate, and wanting more. The only thing I could still want is a slight more malt. Enjoy the Elder with spicy foods, chicken wings, steak, soft cheeses, dark chocolate deserts, or a cigar. Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/11/10/tasting-the-russian-river-pliny-the-elder/\n",
      "-2\tThe beer pours an oranging yellow with amber highlights, kind of like a sunrise… The beer forms a big, pillowy head of rocky white bubbles that are slightly off-white. The head lasts nicely, but does mellow down from its initial height to about a half-finger’s width. As the head dissipates, it leaves a nice sticky patchwork of lacing on the glass. In body the beer is crystal clear and clean, but does present a slight haze from the malt. On the nose, the beer smells of citrus and spicy pine. Floral and herbal notes dance around the edges of the nose but big citrus tangerine and grapefruit are the primary players in the beer. The nose is not blowing me away, but is just a very solid example of a hoppy beer dank pine and a touch of sweet caramel can also be sensed in the smell. As a whole, the smell tends to remind a little of a fresh pineapple blended with pine. On the tongue, the beer tastes surprisingly balanced. The bitters are big and coat the mouth, but there is a strong bready sweetness to add balance. Light stone fruit notes can be picked out in the hop character, as well. The finish sees the strongest bitter kick, which is a bit over powering and should feed any one’s bitter cravings. Acidity in the beer is light but bright on the sides of the cheeks. Again, this beer tastes like a classic DIPA. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet, candied citrus, expanding into fresh Florida oranges, with a touch of orange peel and rind. Grapefruit, pine needles, and pineapple dance in the back along with the malts superbly balanced sweet caramel bread, which helps to give the hops their candied quality. I wasn’t that taken with this beer on the initial sip, but that was foolish of me. Pliny is a subtle beast, building simple complexity from its hops, and making each sip different. Soft boozy heat can be felt in the back of the throat, but that is just another part of the complexity of this beer. This flavor is one I could sip all night. In the mouth, Pliny feels surprisingly on the light side of medium in body, with a fluffy carbonation that pillows the tongue nicely. Mouthfeel is slick, and crisp, making the beer dangerously easy to drink. Slight astringency can be felt as the beer moves across the tongue leaving the mouth only softly tingling with bitters. Saliva does gently pool in the cheeks, but overall the mouth is left rather clean and ready for further sips. Overall, this beer is a whale worthy of whaling after. Beautiful complexity and subtly make this a beer I could drink several of, which is dangerous for its ABV bracket. Where many of the modern DIPA’s slam you in the face with juicy hop character, Pliny is subtle and perfectly balanced. This will please the hop heads and even those that are skeptical to hops. My mother, a diehard stout fan, but “pale and hoppy beer” hater, actually loved this when I brought one over last night. My only complaint is that the nose is mild compared to some DIPA’s, but to be fair to Pliny, its recipe was developed before the designers of those other DIPA’s even knew they liked hops. Pliny the Elder is a pleasure to drink. I can’t wait to get my hands on more Russian River beers.\n",
      "-3\tBottle courtesy of BeachBumC--so glad to have tried this one, thanks!Before drinking this, I'd like to point out the bottle. I like it when breweries put effort into their bottles/labels--it's sort of like reading the liner notes for an album and generally makes the entire &quot;beer experience&quot; more enjoyable as a whole. This one keeps it simple in appearance, and has text (and good beer advice!) in basically the entire free space of the label...for example: &quot;PLINY THE ELDER IS A HISTORICAL FIGURE, DON'T MAKE THE BEER INSIDE THIS BOTTLE ONE!&quot; and &quot;CONSUME PLINY FRESH, OR NOT AT ALL!&quot; Okay, okay, fine!Appearance: Pours a hazy golden orange/light amber with fast moving, medium-sized carbonation bubbles and nearly an inch of fluffy bubbly head. The head disappears exactly the way I would expect it to--it's somewhat persistent but as I type this a great deal of the bubbles pop and what is left is increasingly larger bubbles and a sticky ring of foamy, web-like lacing that have the consistency of soap in a bubble bath. The part of the head that lasts any amount of time (about a half a finger) seems like it'll be sticking around for a bit and ends up being a more consistent, medium bubble size. The carbonation bubbles are not entirely evident from an arm's length (where it sits on the table next to me as I type this up) but when it's held to the light you can see the fine, medium speed and medium sized bubbles moving straight to the top of the glass in just a few lines--doesn't look over-carbonated from here though what there is seems to promise to be decently big.Smell: Floral hops and honey are the huge notes in this brew, as well as a strong pink grapefruit scent--no huge surprises there. It smells absolutely wonderful, and has a mellow tone to it. I'm also getting notes of sweet molasses, maple syrup, caramel and, to a lesser extent, brown sugar out of the nose as well as a slightly spicy alcohol and hops note which comes across as black pepper and maybe the slightest hint of wintergreen (though this isn't at all hot and is blended entirely nicely with the other scents in the beer. I'm also smelling cold apple juice. There's a very mild citrus note--maybe a slight lemon zest and a tiny squeeze of orange juice blended in.I hate to compare beers to one another, but because these two are quite similar--it does smell quite a bit like Hopslam, though a more mellow, slightly more honey-toned version. Smooth and creamy. I should note that as it warms, the honey notes come out more and more and it mellows, smelling less like the familiar, crisp Hopslam I have come to know and love and more bready, grainy, apple toned and dark. It retains its heavy floral notes, however, throughout the life of the beer.Taste: The first notes that I get out of this, oddly enough, are white grapes and pears (though they are not particularly dominant as I continue to drink), followed by a light, lemon and grapefruit hop aftertaste. There are also apple and orange juices present here, but their sweetness is not very dominant due to the bitterness of the hops, which is quite intense. The bitterness itself is not sharp and biting, but dull, dark, and in the background--though quite persistent. This gives it the impression of an almost funky note, though it is still more hoppy than anything else. The floral smell of the hops really changes to hay and grass--and a slight pine--in the taste. Definitely becomes far more orange and lemon juice flavored--and significantly sweeter--as it warms. There's a definite honey note, but the citrus and bitter hop notes dominate far more (though I will note that the warmer it gets the more the nice honey note comes out as well as a maple sugar note, though it's not very syrupy. These both blend very nicely with everything else). The smallest hint of yeasty, sweet, bread comes through as well, though that's not to say that it's malty. Also as it warms, there's an ever-so-slight sourness that starts to come through.Mouthfeel: Not biting, and the carbonation keeps it crisp yet subdued. The aftertaste is very persistent and bitter yet manages to not be abrasive. Very smooth and creamy. I'm trying to figure out words with which to describe the very present, very persistent, yet non-abrasive carbonation. It is there at exactly the right moments and disappears at exactly the right moments to perfectly complement the taste. A higher carbonation level would have resulted in it being too abrasive and a lower level would undercut the great flavors present in the taste. No heat whatsoever.Drinkability: One to sip, but it's entirely delicious. The only thing really holding this one back from going down quicker is the bitterness, which is great and totally acceptable for the style and ABV. The combination of smell and taste is really quite excellent. I love when a beer can have significantly different yet still complementary smell and taste elements--nicely done.\n",
      "-4\tIt seems that the more I drink this beer, the better it gets (or perhaps the more I appreciate it?). 2nd Review: 8/9/11 bottle, consumed 9/1/11, poured into a balloon tulip.A: Pours golden orange yellow, fairly clear, with a 2+ finger tight white head with great retention and picture perfect lacing. S: Tons of tangerine and tropical fruits (pineapple, maybe mango and apricot), pine and floral notes right behind it. Just a touch of sweet pale malt. Very ripe and fleshy. T: Definitely better the second time around. Very bright, but mellow citrus and tropical fruits with some floral notes adding a little depth. There's a bit of pine, but not all that much bitterness, at least compared to huge bitter-bombs. There a nice slightly sweetness from a fairly solid pale malt base in the middle. The citrus hops turns soft and fleshy from the middle to finish. Slight pine and lemon/orange peel (pineapple too) finish with little lingering bitterness. Very soft. NO alcohol noticeable at all and I get no unpleasant esters either. The downside is the flavor intensity goes a little limp rather quick as it dies a bit in the middle mouth. M: Medium to slightly light bodied, moderate carbonation. Extremely smooth and soft for a DIPA, not quite as resinous, sticky, or bitter as I'd like, but it's insanely easy to drink.O: This is far better than the last batch I tried, much more bright and vibrant with a bigger flavor profile. There is no doubt that this is one extremely well crafted and finest DIPAs on the market. That said, I put this a notch below Hill Farmstead as I prefer that punch of bitterness and more intense hop flavor. I also found that the big, bold flavors lasted forever while the hops in this go really mellow/soft and fade rather quickly. Top 10 DIPA, but not the best I've ever had.----My first bottle, 7/19, consumed 8/11. Poured into a wine-style tasting glass. Reviewed from notes:A: Pours golden pale yellow, surprisingly clear, with about a finger of head. Leaves pretty good lacing. S: Big citrus and tropical fruit hop nose with plenty of pine and floral notes to balance/add depth to the hop profile. There's a slight herbal dankness in the background. A big, balanced, and juicy hop profile.T: Follows the nose, but not in intensity. Has a rather soft hop profile with the citrus and tropical fruits and a decent helping of pine resin, though not as potent and bitter as I would have expected. There's a light malt base with just a touch of sweetness, just enough to let the hops shine. Fairly dry finish with a little lingering bitterness. M: Medium body, very smooth, moderate to slightly light carbonation. Has a soft and clean feel with a fairly crisp finish.O: While this was a solid DIPA, the taste was a little bit of a let down compared to the nose. I was expecting a big, bold hop profile, but it was rather soft and subdued with just a little bitterness. It kind of reminded me of the difference between Hill Farmstead's Citra DIPA and the Abner/Galaxy (Citra soft while Abner/Galaxy was just huge and in your face). Perhaps this is indeed a tame batch, I'll definitely give the next batch another try. Best DIPA I've ever had? Not this bottle, no. Great, but not the best.\n",

      "1639\tPours a hazy golden amber with a slightly orange tint and a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of sticky lace behind as it slowly recedes. Nose is quite aromatic with strong scents of piney hops along with some fresh grapefruit. Taste is big-time hoppiness, but there is a fair amount of sweet malt to help keeps things somewhat in balance. Really deliciousthis ones a winner.\n",
      "2182\tThank you Brian for bringing this bottle to Lakewood!A) Golden color to be expected from an IPA, but the head leaves a thin layer of bubbles that cover 90-95% of the top resembling the fog over the swamps of Dagobah.S) Hoppy, and perhaps a hint of citrus that is difficult to pin down.T) First impression is &quot;This isn't that hoppy, what's the big deal here&quot; and then the tart flavor of Grapefruit rushes in and brings me back to fond memories of fresh-squeezed Grapefruit juice in a small hotel in Argentina. As a person who ALWAYS chooses grapefruit (in addition to coffee) when given the option on a breakfast menu, this was a real treat indeed!M) Tart, biting, acidic and dry... If you close your eyes, you could truly believe you are in fact drinking grapefruit juice.O) An all around great beer.... still not the &quot;knock it out of the park&quot; life-altering experience the hype would lend oneself to believe, but a really great beer that I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to taste. I would certainly pick it up frequently if I were in an area that had this fine beer distributed.\n",
      "2713\tGot this in a trade with Sideswipe. Bottle poured into pint glass. Looks pretty good. Lighter in color than some dark apricot colored ones... Maybe a dark gold with 2 fingers of head and sticky lacing. I see some sediments too. Smells of grapefruit and a little pineapple? Never smelled pineapple in a DIPA, but it works nicely. Also smells fresh, grassy, and a little piney. Not noticing a whole lot of malt, but there are hints of some sweet maltiness shining through. Taste is fresh grapefruit and citrus. Even a bit of orange/lemon. A little pine towards the back of the throat, but finishes malty then citrus. Very refreshing and clean finish. This is just right on mouthfeel. Sometimes you getthat piney feel that coats your throat, but not here. Carbonation level helps this one smoothly down my throat... And the clean finish makes it even more enjoyable. If I could get this one all the time, I would certainly drink it regularily. If you can get it, drink it. If you can't, trade for it. It really is very nice. It deserves its high level of praise.\n",
      "1010\tThis beer is well spoken for here. I get floral grapefruits and oranges in both the smell and the taste and the balance of grapefruits and oranges tilts to the oranges as it warms up in the glass a little. The feel is perfectly viscous, the carbonation is perfectly carbonated, and the look is perfect looking. It's a bright orange sunset with bubbles.This is my favorite beer and I consider myself lucky to have it within a 5 minute walk of my house. I never drink more than one in a night and rarely more than one a week. The day I get bored of this beer will be a sad one indeed.\n"

A generous malt bill and a solid dollop of honey provide just enough body to keep the balance in check, resulting in a remarkably drinkable rendition of the Double IPA style."
